# Fastable
Quick HTML table generator.

## Implementation
It's very easy to implement Fastable as it is now. The two principal ways are:

- Installing via npm
```
npm install fastable
```
Then you can `import { Fastable } from 'fastable'` or link `fastable.bundle.js` as shown below.
  
- Direct linking

You can also download `dist/fastable.bundle.js` and refer to it in your HTML file.

```
<script src="fastable.bundle.js"></script>
```

- Usage

To use Fastable, you must create a new Fastable object first.

```
var fast = new Fastable();
```

More details on the example folder.

=======
You can also simply download `fastable.js` from either `src/` or `dist/` and saving it somewhere in your project's folder.
