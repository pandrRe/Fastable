# Fastable
Quick HTML table generator.

## Implementation
It's very easy to implement Fastable as it is now. The two principal ways are:

- Installing via npm
```
npm install fastable
```
And then referring to `src/fastable.js` (or `dist/fastable.js` if you need ES5 support).

- Direct linking

You can also simply download `fastable.js` from either `src/` or `dist/` and saving it somewhere in your project's folder.
